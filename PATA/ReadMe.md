# PATA: A Look Back at Parallel ATA Technology  

## 🚀 Introduction  
In this presentation, we explore **Parallel ATA (PATA)**, the technology that was once the standard for connecting storage devices like hard drives and optical drives to computer motherboards. This presentation covers the history of PATA, its technical features, architecture, signaling, and how it compares to modern interfaces like SATA. We also delve into dual-drive configurations and the differences between PATA and IDE. This presentation is ideal for computer science students, hardware engineers, and anyone interested in the evolution of storage technologies.
